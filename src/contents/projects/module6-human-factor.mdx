> ## Short Explanation

This programme module covers Human Factor at the University of Essex Online and lasts six weeks. As I progress through the units, I document all the achievements, valuable insights, screenshots of contributions and unit summaries below.

> ## Module Goals

Module participants are individually required to look into the bigger picture of human factors within the context of Cybersecurity. Understanding the importance of human behaviour when designing computing systems was the main objective of the module. Limitations of human capabilities and major data breaches originating from human behaviours and their consequences, including designing security solutions to aid potential shortcomings in achieving adequate security levels, were also part of the module objectives.

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 6-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

This unit summary covers units between 1-3, including the following outcomes:

- Develop an understanding of the security issues and risks associated with how people interact with computing systems.
- Appreciate the impact of human factors and activities on security of computing systems in an organisation.
- Develop the awareness to fit security design to humans.
- Evaluate available techniques and technologies for a given design solution.
- Develop the capacity to evaluate usable security design.
- Understand the concept of mental models and their use.
- Develop the ability to apply mental models to usable security design.
- Develop the awareness and the legal basis for accessibility in the context of usable security.

### Unit 4-6

This unit summary covers units between 4-6, including the following outcomes:

- Effectively plan a usable security design solution.
- Appraise critically the techniques and their applications to the design process.
- Develop the ability to evaluate a usable design solution.
- Develop the ability to apply and evaluate mental models for risk communication.
- Become the organisational culture and its impact on security.
- Develop the awareness of legal and ethical issues related usable security.
- Understand the usable security issues in current and emergent technologies.
- Critically assess user behaviours using mental models.
- Develop the ability to identify and effectively apply mental models to design usable security.
- Effectively apply metaphors to effectively communicate risk to users.

Responding to other peers' viewpoints was particularly interesting during this module. This exercise helped me develop crucial literature review knowledge and research skills, especially arguing views based on publicly available secondary research data.

### Review 1 - 1866469252

Overview:
A well-structured essay discussing potential threats, including decent supportive references: however, the essay only discusses potential threats without providing a detailed view on contributing human factors for those threats nor addressing or proposing ways to improve the security of the ASMIS system (including the management’s requirements).

Strengths:

- Developing on the most common potential human-centric threats
- Solid supportive material and reference selection
- Recommendations to follow internationally recognised standards, frameworks and best practices

Weaknesses:

- (Siau & Lee, 2004; Dobing & Parsons, 2006) explain crucial aspects of use case diagrams. Clearly describing what kind of relationship exists between different actors (e.g., dependent, extending, etc.), including what type of operations could be performed through the system in an authenticated or non-authenticated fashion were missing. Therefore, developing relevant security requirements, modelling human-centric threats and addressing those threats were also missing from the essay.
- Abomhara et al. (2015) describe how the identification of potential threats for both technological and human-centric can be made in a tabulated way based on the STRIDE. Thus, the linkage between threat actors, threats, and mitigations was missing in the essay.
- Three human factors are required to be identified as part of the assignment. However, no linkage between those human factors and potential threats is seen in the essay.
- (Sasse & Flechais, 2005) discuss the importance of including human factors in the early phases of software development to achieve more secure and usable systems. It would have been excellent to see any reference to this, including the AEGIS (Appropriate and Effective Guidance for Information Security) sociotechnical software engineering methodology.
