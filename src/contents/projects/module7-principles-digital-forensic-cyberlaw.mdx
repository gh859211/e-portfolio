> ## Module Assignments

### Module Assigment 1

Participants of the module are required to carry out comprehensive research based on a formulated cybercrime case study. The analysis is expected to include why particular cybercrime was chosen, potential costs linked to that cybercrime, issues and challenges identified as part of chosen cybercrime, implications and tools used to deal with cybercrime and legislation developed on a national and international level. Additionally, participants are required to competently present this with a recorded-visual presentation.
