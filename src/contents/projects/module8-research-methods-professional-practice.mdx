  Summary Post:
  
  _Abi’s case helped us better understand how certain approaches and widely-recognised hypotheses could be used to minimise potential bias risk, misinterpretation of data and questionable research methods. For example, the idea of making it possible to support nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor food analyses questioned the validity of the collected data, including its harmfulness. Additionally, peer responses further strengthened the importance of methods that can positively contribute to data validation processes and measures that are being used to minimise certain risks for increasing transparency and creditability of report publications in research._

  _(Masson, 2011; Nix & Barnette, 1998) further discuss the shortcomings of the null-hypothesis approach. Although the hypothesis is widely used across different fields to evaluate evidence, these shortcomings always need to be considered with specific prerequisites. This conclusion is also in line with and further supports the view of the second peer response._

  _In addition to that, Titus et al. (2008) discuss about reported research misconduct that occurred in the United States. Their analyses show interesting results regarding research misconduct, including concerns about unreported ones and the importance of properly functioning whistleblower processes. For example, they identify Fabrication, Falsification and Plagiarism as the most prominent misbehaviours and suggest implementing measures like zero tolerance, protection of whistleblowers, clarification on reporting channels and modelling ethical behaviour. Furthermore, (Resnik & Shamoo, 2011) state the importance of having a self-regulative code of conduct targeting the research integrity field. For example, The Singapore Statement on Research and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity shares common principles like honesty, accountability, professionalism and stewardship, including responsibilities targeting researchers to conduct ethical research. Therefore, these discussions also further support the third peer response's view, including the initial post's main message._

The full-text is also provided below:

_Overall Module Reflections_

_Approach:_
_As recommended in the University’s e-portfolio guidelines, this document uses Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model and consists of three sections called What? So what? Now what?._

_What?_
_The Research Methods & Professional Practices module required students to understand what is the purpose of research. Therefore, several assessments and milestones, such as carrying out comprehensive reviews of relevant fields based on chosen domains, getting familiar with methods used in scientific research, audio-narrated presentations and frequent e-portfolio entries reflecting students’ views in progressive learning discussions, are expected to complete throughout the module._

_As one of the participants in the module, I needed to conduct extensive analyses based on publicly available secondary research data covering the importance of tools and techniques in suspect and criminal profiling. Additionally, producing a literature review material where critically evaluating the relevant field, including design and methodology aspects of research and data analyses, was the main objective of the assessment._

_Furthermore, as I progress towards the mid-phases of the module, I am also required to competently present an audio-narrated presentation covering a research proposal about the use of multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDA) in terms of potential improvements for the risk management subdomain and specifically for risk assessment methods of information security management systems (ISMS)._

_Additionally, working on raw data, performing statistical analyses, and mastering essential tools and techniques used in hypothesis testing and summary measurement are also required to complete whilst progressing toward the end of the module._

_So What?_
_(Misra & McKean, 2000) investigates issues and their interconnections affecting undergraduate and postgraduate students’ academic stress in terms of anxiety, time management and overall satisfaction. The authors’ study reveals that time management behaviours are considered the biggest culprit that significantly affects stress levels, including noting significant differences across gender-specific measures._

_It was the same for me as a student participating in this module. Attempting to study a higher education programme whilst working in a fast-paced environment without an adequate academic background even made it more challenging to complete this module sufficiently. Moreover, the mere grade received in the literature review assignment further strengthened the lack of effective time management skills._

_Furthermore, that helped me as a student to realise a revised approach was needed to improve time management skills across all departments covering academic, personal and work-related areas. Constantly prioritising activities and spending my time more efficiently on essentially needed requirements of the module greatly helped to improve and minimise potential side effects concerning time management. Additionally, that revised approach allowed me to engage more frequently with peers in collaborative discussions and improved my confidence level in presentation skills._

_Now What?_
_The Research Methods & Professional Practice module was enjoyable in general. It allowed me to develop knowledge and understanding concerning respective areas, such as how research could be adequately performed, what essential requirements must be part of the research, how potential risks affecting research like bias and conflict of interest risks could be minimised, how certain techniques and tools could be used to analyse data and interpretation of research results within the module._

_Additionally, the module also enabled looking into more specifics of research methods and encouraged me to engage more frequently in collaborative learning discussions with peers. Working on inputs from other peers, including responding to specific case studies to reflect on personal views further helped to improve communication skills and empathy. Moreover, although the module was considerably demanding, it also helped to develop my thinking further. This was undeniably important, especially to improve readiness for the upcoming thesis project._

_All in all, it was great to benefit from all of the module assessments and achieved milestones. It definitely helped to improve my knowledge and understanding of the field and most importantly how to apply what is learnt during the entire module in future, including thesis projects._

_Lastly, I also would like to share a suggestion as part of this overall module reflection since this is going to be published under the relevant section of the e-portfolio. E-portfolios can be very time-consuming and demanding depending on the details that need to be presented and the technologies employed. Properly maintaining content could be even more challenging, especially if you are not a full-time student and needed to make frequent entries all the time during the entire lifecycle of modules. Therefore, applying techniques to improve time management and organisation skills in your everyday life greatly helps you to stay on top of things and achieve desired outcomes._
