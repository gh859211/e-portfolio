> ## Short Explanation

This programme module covers Research Methods and Professional Practice at the University of Essex Online and lasts 12 weeks. As I progress through the units, I document all the achievements, valuable insights, screenshots of contributions and unit summaries below.

> ## Module Goals

This module provides a practical foundation in research methods. That includes getting familiar with various tools and techniques used in research. Additionally, this module aims to support participants in:
- studying and reflecting on key principles and methods in research based on the scientific method and relevant to various disciplines
- examining various research strategies and designs as applicable to projects at hand
- developing research competencies, in particular those relating to the collection and analysis of data types to enable a critical design and evaluation of independent research
- take a reflective and independent approach to the learning process

> ## Module Outcomes

### Unit 1-3

This 12-week module introduces the various core elements of the MSc. Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online. It intends to ensure a basic understanding of the primary skills covered in complete detail during all relevant modules. It also provides insight and understanding of how the different practices and occupational roles combine to offer a robust body of knowledge and skillset required to succeed in the field. Furthermore, it is beneficial to all who would master this critical field to gain a fuller understanding of the contribution and importance of all elements. As the units tend to build one upon another and contain summary review and reflection every few units, these note entries will follow a similar track and cover three units in each.

> ## Module Assignments

### Module Assigment 1 - Literature Review

Participants of the module are required to carry out comprehensive research (literature review) based on a formulated case study. The analysis is expected to include critically evaluating existing literature, research desing and methodolgy based on the chosen case study.

### Module Assigment 2 - Research Proposal Presentation

Participants are required to prepare an audio-narrated presentation fulfilling the module outcomes, critically evaluating existing literature, research and design methodologies used, and data analyses made for the chosen research area. This audio-narrated presentation is also expected to be presented based on the following structure:
- Project Title.
- Significance/Contribution to the discipline/Research Problem.
- Research Question.
- Aims and Objectives.
- Key literature related to the project.
- Methodology/Development strategy/Research Design.
- Ethical considerations and risk assessment (as part of your ethical approval application).
- Description of artefact(s) that will be created (if applicable).
- Timeline of proposed activities.

### Collaborative Learning Discussions
These optional learning discussions that are based on cases study were helpful in terms of developing particular skills. I had an opportunity to collaborate with several peers on a particular case study. The links below have details about the received responses to my post and replies I sent to these peers.

  Summary Post:
  _Abiâ€™s case helped us better understand how certain approaches and widely-recognised hypotheses could be used to minimise potential bias risk, misinterpretation of data and questionable research methods. For example, the idea of making it possible to support nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor food analyses questioned the validity of the collected data, including its harmfulness. Additionally, peer responses further strengthened the importance of methods that can positively contribute to data validation processes and measures that are being used to minimise certain risks for increasing transparency and creditability of report publications in research._

  _(Masson, 2011; Nix & Barnette, 1998) further discuss the shortcomings of the null-hypothesis approach. Although the hypothesis is widely used across different fields to evaluate evidence, these shortcomings always need to be considered with specific prerequisites. This conclusion is also in line with and further supports the view of the second peer response._

  _In addition to that, Titus et al. (2008) discuss about reported research misconduct that occurred in the United States. Their analyses show interesting results regarding research misconduct, including concerns about unreported ones and the importance of properly functioning whistleblower processes. For example, they identify Fabrication, Falsification and Plagiarism as the most prominent misbehaviours and suggest implementing measures like zero tolerance, protection of whistleblowers, clarification on reporting channels and modelling ethical behaviour. Furthermore, (Resnik & Shamoo, 2011) state the importance of having a self-regulative code of conduct targeting the research integrity field. For example, The Singapore Statement on Research and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity shares common principles like honesty, accountability, professionalism and stewardship, including responsibilities targeting researchers to conduct ethical research. Therefore, these discussions also further support the third peer response's view, including the initial post's main message._
